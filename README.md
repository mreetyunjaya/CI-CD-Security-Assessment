# CI-CD-Security-Assessment
CI-CD Security Assessment using Opensource Tools 

Use-Case
1.	As an Architect to manage the security requirement and mentoring the developers for secure coding

2.	As a DevSecOps engineer I want to track and manage vulnerabilities during entire lifecycle of application development consolidating findings from multiple sources

3.	As a developer I want to find vulnerabilities in OSS dependencies to avoid supply chain or OSS risk

4.	As a DevSecOps engineer I want to find vulnerabilities in container images to secure shippable workloads

5.	As a developer I want to check static code for flaws to mitigate them as early as possible

6.	As a QA engineer, I want to check runtime for vulnerabilities to identify flaws early in the cycle
